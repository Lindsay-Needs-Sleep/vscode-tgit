## 1.5.1

- tgit.resolve is repo-level only. file-level opens the same dialog, but filtered to only show the current file, and only if it's conflicted.  Repo-level just shows all conflicted files.

## 1.5.0

- Added devcontainer support via `settings.json` `tgit.remotePathOverrides`
  - may also work for supporting other remote environments
- Support multi-folder workspaces
  - If a command is issued on a file in project-folder #2, then it should open the TortoiseGit UI for project #2, not project #1
- Added Git Revision Graph (ctrl+g, ctrl+g)
- Added Output panel info/warnings/errors to help the user
- Strictly differentiate "Diff" vs "File Diff"
  - "File Diff" should try to open a file diff, if there is no valid file it should fail, not open the unexpected project diff.
